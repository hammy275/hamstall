# hamstall
A very small package manager that really shouldn't be used (it's more of a "see if I can design this" king of thing).

##If you really want to use it
At the moment, this program only supports the installing and uninstalling of .tar.gz files.
Not much sanity checking takes place and this is very much in "beta" (even though this really shouldn't be used anyways)

##Installation
Download this repo, then run hamstall.py with Python3!
