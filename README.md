# hamstall
hamstall is a lightweight package manager for Linux (and similar) systems that manages programs stored in archives! It's built off of Python 3 and currently manages .zip, .7z, .rar, .tar.gz, and .tar.xz archives! It has an array of features besides the typical installing/uninstalling including path management, .desktop creation, and alias creation (binlinks)!

## Getting Started
Simply download this repo! Make sure you have Python 3 installed and you should be set! You can invoke first time setup by navigating to the directory where hamstall is stored and running ```python3 hamstall.py -f```. Afterwards, feel free to use ```hamstall -h``` to view a list of commands!
