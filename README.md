# hamstall
hamstall is a lightweight package manager for Linux (and similar) systems! It's built off of Python 3 and currently manages .zip, .tar.gz, and .tar.xz archives!

## Getting Started
Simply download this repo. Make sure you have Python 3 installed (```sudo apt install python3``` on Linux systems) and you should be set! You can invoke first time setup by navigating to the directory where hamstall is stored and running ```python3 hamstall.py -f```. Afterwards, feel free to use ```hamstall -h``` to view a list of commands!
