# hamstall
hamstall is a very lightweight (and very much still in testing) package manager for UNIX based systems! It's built off of Python 3 and currently manages .zip, .tar.gz, and .tar.xz archives! I would personally not recommend using it as you will have to most likely fix things as updates are released. As this software is early in development, I am currently not adding backwards compatability!

## If you really want to use it
Not much sanity checking takes place and this is very much in "beta". You can begin with getting started below.

## Getting Started
Simply download this repo (or just the hamstall.py) Python file. Make sure you have Python 3 installed (```sudo apt install python3``` on Linux systems) and you should be set! You can invoke first time setup by navigating to the directory where hamstall is stored and running ```python3 hamstall.py -f```. Afterwards, feel free to use ```hamstall -h``` to view a list of commands!
